Our primary goal is to equip MESA students with the skills and attitudes necessary for their successful transfer to university.</p>
    <p>MESA works closely with industry partners and the University of California, California State University, the California Community Colleges, the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and the State Department of Education. MESA is nationally recognized for its innovative academic development program.</p>
